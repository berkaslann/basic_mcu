# basic_mcu
A basic 8-bit microcontroller project is designed and implemented for the term project of VLSI Design course. Implementation is done with the XFAB_180nm PDK. Layout of the some parts of the design are drawn. This MCU includes
  *  8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with adding and subtracting capabilities
  *  Logic controller
  *  Programmable instruction memory
  *  Data memory (2x8 bits)
  *  Output memory (8x8 bits)

Initial and final project reports can be found in this repository. All the building blocks and their design choices are explained in detail. Conceptual design drawings and images of schematics, layout(only some parts are drawn), test results are given. Since the design was made in the laboratory computers, design files are not available.
